        Khoi Tran is a data analyst, app developer, designer, and visual
        thinker. Believing the future as a result of all past experience, he did
        not settle down on earning a stats degree, but also inspired himself to
        be a developer using his aesthetic aptitude to build appealing and
        useful products. With the principles of simplicity, clarity, and
        structurality, he has coded, designed, and managed various projects
        successfully. This philosophy, along with strict self-discipline, has
        shaped Khoiâ€™s interdisciplinary practice today.
